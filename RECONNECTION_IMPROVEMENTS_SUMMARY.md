# Reconnection System Improvements Summary

## Overview

The game's reconnection system has been significantly enhanced to provide a better user experience for players who temporarily disconnect. Two key improvements have been implemented:

1. **10-Second Grace Period** - Players who disconnect get a 10-second window to reconnect without disrupting the game
2. **Judge Role Preservation** - If a judge disconnects, their role is preserved until other players vote to continue without them

## Key Features

### üïê 10-Second Grace Period

- When a player disconnects, a 10-second grace period begins
- During this period, the game continues normally for all other players
- If the disconnected player reconnects within 10 seconds, they seamlessly rejoin without any disruption
- Only after the grace period expires does the game pause and show disconnection dialogs to other players

### üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge Role Preservation

- When a judge disconnects, their judge role is preserved
- Other players can vote to either "wait for the judge" or "continue without them"
- If players vote to "wait", the judge retains their role when they reconnect
- If players vote to "continue", a new judge is automatically selected
- This prevents the frustrating experience of losing judge status due to temporary network issues

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

- **`src/server/handlers/reconnectionHandlers.ts`** - Core reconnection logic
- **`src/server/types/socketTypes.ts`** - Added grace period constants and context
- **`src/pages/api/socket.ts`** - Server initialization updates
- **`scripts/test-*.ts`** - Updated test suites to verify new functionality

### Key Changes

#### Grace Period Implementation

```typescript
// Added 10-second grace period constant
export const INITIAL_GRACE_PERIOD = 10000; // 10 seconds

// New grace period timer management
gracePeriodTimers: Map<string, NodeJS.Timeout>;
```

#### Judge Role Logic

```typescript
// Updated resumeGame function to accept shouldReassignJudge parameter
export const resumeGame = (
  context: ServerContext,
  roomCode: string,
  shouldReassignJudge: boolean = false
) => {
  // Only reassign judge if explicitly requested
  if (shouldReassignJudge && room.state.phase !== "game_over") {
    assignRandomJudge(room);
  }
};
```

#### Enhanced Disconnection Handling

```typescript
// Two-phase disconnection process:
// 1. Grace period (10 seconds) - game continues
// 2. Pause game if no reconnection - show voting dialog
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before

- ‚ùå Any disconnection immediately paused the game for everyone
- ‚ùå Judge role was lost immediately upon disconnection
- ‚ùå Brief network hiccups caused major game disruptions

### After

- ‚úÖ 10-second grace period allows seamless reconnections
- ‚úÖ Judge role preserved until players vote otherwise
- ‚úÖ Quick network issues don't disrupt gameplay
- ‚úÖ Players have control over whether to wait for disconnected judges

## Testing

All functionality has been thoroughly tested with automated test suites:

### Test Results ‚úÖ

- **Grace Period Test**: Verifies 10-second reconnection window works correctly
- **Judge Reconnection Test**: Confirms judge role preservation through disconnect/reconnect cycles
- **General Reconnection Test**: Validates overall system stability

### Test Commands

```powershell
# Test grace period functionality
npx ts-node --project tsconfig.scripts.json scripts/test-grace-period.ts

# Test judge role preservation
npx ts-node --project tsconfig.scripts.json scripts/test-judge-reconnection.ts

# Test overall reconnection system
npx ts-node --project tsconfig.scripts.json scripts/test-reconnection.ts
```

## Impact on Game Flow

The improvements maintain the original game flow while making it more resilient to network issues:

1. **Lobby ‚Üí Judge Selection**: Same as before
2. **Prompt Selection**: If judge disconnects, grace period begins
3. **Sound Selection**: Quick reconnections don't interrupt other players
4. **Playback/Judging**: Judge role preserved through voting system
5. **Results**: Seamless continuation after reconnection

## Benefits

### For Players

- üöÄ **Smoother gameplay** - Brief disconnections don't disrupt the fun
- ü§ù **Fairer judge system** - Judge role isn't lost due to network issues
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Reduced waiting** - 10-second grace period eliminates most disruptions
- üéÆ **Better mobile experience** - Mobile players less likely to lose progress

### For Game Hosts

- üì± **Fewer complaints** about disconnection issues
- üîÑ **More consistent games** that don't break due to network hiccups
- üë• **Happier players** who don't lose their turn due to technical issues

## Future Considerations

- Consider making the grace period configurable (currently hardcoded to 10 seconds)
- Monitor real-world usage to potentially adjust timing
- Consider extending grace period logic to other critical game phases
- Potential to add visual indicators showing grace period status to players
