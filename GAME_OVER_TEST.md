# Game Over Testing Steps

## Manual Test to Verify Game Over Fix

### Step-by-Step Test Process:

1. **Open two browser windows:**
   - Window 1: http://localhost:3000/main-screen (Main TV display)
   - Window 2: http://localhost:3000 (Player device)

2. **Create and join game:**
   - In Window 2: Click "Create Room" with player name "Player1"
   - Note the 4-letter room code
   - In Window 1: Enter the same room code and join as main screen

3. **Add more players (if needed):**
   - Open additional browser tabs/windows
   - Join the same room with different player names
   - Need minimum 3 players to start

4. **Start the game:**
   - In Window 2: Click "Start Game" when ready

5. **Play through rounds quickly:**
   - Each round: Judge selects prompt → Players pick sounds → Judge picks winner
   - **Important**: Keep track of round numbers (should show X/5)
   - Play until you reach round 5/5

6. **Test the final round completion:**
   - Complete round 5/5 normally
   - Judge picks a winner for the final round
   - **Expected behavior**: Game should transition to GAME OVER screen
   - **Bug behavior**: Game gets stuck saying "Next round starting soon..."

### What to Check:

✅ **After fixing the JSX syntax issue:**
- [ ] Round 5/5 completes normally
- [ ] Game transitions to "🎊 Game Over!" screen on both main-screen and player devices
- [ ] Final scores are displayed correctly
- [ ] Winner is clearly shown
- [ ] No "Next round starting soon..." message appears

### Console Debugging:

Check browser console for these messages:
- `🏁 Game completion check: currentRound=5, maxRounds=5...`
- `🎉 Game ending: Round 5/5 or score X reached threshold`
- `gameStateChanged event received: game_over`

### Quick Fix Summary:

The issue was a **JSX syntax error** in the `GameOverComponent` in `src/app/game/page.tsx`:
- Missing proper spacing between closing `</div>` tag and the button element
- This prevented the component from rendering properly
- Fixed by adding proper line breaks and indentation

### Expected Result:

After the fix, the game should properly show a beautiful game over screen with:
- 🎊 Game Over! header
- 🏆 Winner announcement  
- Final scores leaderboard
- "Play Again!" button
