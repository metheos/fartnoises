# Manual Validation Checklist for Multiplayer Fixes

## 🚀 Quick Validation Steps

### Setup (2 minutes)

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in browser
2. Create a room as "Host"
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in 2 more browser tabs/windows
4. Join the same room as "Player2" and "Player3"
5. Start the game from Host's interface

### ✅ Test 1: Prompt Selection Timer (30 seconds)

**Expected**: Judge sees 3 prompts with 15-second countdown timer

- [ ] Timer shows "15" and counts down to "14", "13", "12"...
- [ ] All players can see the countdown
- [ ] If judge doesn't select, first prompt is auto-selected after 15 seconds
- [ ] If judge selects manually, timer stops and sound selection begins

### ✅ Test 2: Sound Selection Timer (1 minute)

**Expected**: Non-judge players see sound selection with 45-second countdown

- [ ] Timer shows "45" and counts down in real-time
- [ ] All players see the same countdown
- [ ] Players can select 2 sounds while timer runs
- [ ] Timer stops when all players submit OR when it reaches 0

### ✅ Test 3: Faster Playback Transition (30 seconds)

**Expected**: Quick transition from sound submission to judging

- [ ] After all players submit sounds, transition takes ~4-5 seconds (not 8+ seconds)
- [ ] Playback phase appears briefly
- [ ] Judging phase starts quickly

### ✅ Test 4: Winner Display (30 seconds)

**Expected**: Comprehensive winner announcement

- [ ] Judge selects a winning combination
- [ ] ALL players see winner announcement with:
  - 🏆 Winner's name prominently displayed
  - 🎵 The winning sound combination shown
  - 📊 Updated scores for all players
- [ ] Main screen (if open) also shows winner details

## 🎯 Success Criteria
